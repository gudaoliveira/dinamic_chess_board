# ♟️Dinamic Chess Board
This was my first contact with Google Apps Script to automate functions on Google Sheets. This project generates a custom chess board based on the number of columns and rows inputted by the user

## 💻How does it work?

- Simply just change the values on the **"D2"** and **"H2"** cell for the numbers of Rows and Columns of the board, respectively and click it on the **"GENERATE"** button.
- That's it, now just wait for the sheet to print the board
- Note that the **GENERATE** button must have the _[start.gs](https://github.com/gudaoliveira/dinamic_chess_board/blob/main/start.gs)_ script assigned to work


## 🧠Known Issues
This is a good piece of portifolio to me, but it could be a great piece of portifolio for us! So feel free to contribute in any way that you might think i would enhance the project

- One thing that i notice was that with large values the sheet can be a little slow, so, that's something that would be good to improve
- Besides that maybe adding more formatting options would be a good idea
